# From text

- Hashtables are arrays of list.  Get the position in the array by doing `hash(key) % array_length`
- When you need an array-like data structure that offers dynamic resizing, you would usually use an ArrayList.
- Use a StringBuilder when possible so that you do not create new string every time.

# java
- Use hashmap instead of python dict
- Use charAt to get a char from string at certain position
- You can sort a string using `sort(str)`
